## Overview

This app is my personal project that will be used for data entry involving BCBAs workflow. I used the starter template from AWS to build a basis for my project. The stack uses React+Vite and AWS Amplify. Implements user authentication, API, and database capabilities to store previous data and to compare with as well.

"This template equips you with a foundational React application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB."

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.
